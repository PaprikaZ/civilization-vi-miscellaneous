# Civilization VI Miscellaneous

## Mods

This repository including some mods to adjust various modifier effect argument, which is based on game's defects and my own playing presets, habits. These mods are:

- governor adjustment

## Maps

Civilization VI random map generation not improve too much. So much so that, lack of some typical model in its predecessor, e.g map with original birth continent and new undeveloped continents.

So some manual and time costing modification needed. Save those played map to here. I don't ensure these map met your taste.

## Playing

Actually when I play Civilization III and Civilization IV, I already do make lots of map and modifications to improvement gaming experiences. But these data got lost finally. This repository is a backup of same kind things of Civilization VI at this time.

I recommend to use difficulty emperor(AI is stupid comparing with its predecessor) with some composition of mods and extra map modification to ensure balance.
